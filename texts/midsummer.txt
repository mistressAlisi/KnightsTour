Attendants THESEUS Now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hour Draws on apace four happy days bring in Another moon but O methinks how slow This old moon wanes she lingers my desires Like to a step dame or a dowager Long withering out a young man revenue HIPPOLYTA Four days will quickly steep themselves in night Four nights will quickly dream away the time And then the moon like to a silver bow New bent in heaven shall behold the night Of our solemnities THESEUS Go Philostrate Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth Turn melancholy forth to funerals The pale companion is not for our pomp Exit PHILOSTRATE Hippolyta I wood thee with my sword And won thy love doing thee injuries But I will wed thee in another key With pomp with triumph and with revelling Enter EGEUS HERMIA LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS EGEUS Happy be Theseus our renowned duke THESEUS Thanks good Egeus whats the news with thee EGEUS Full of vexation come I with complaint Against my child my daughter Hermia Stand forth Demetrius My noble lord This man hath my consent to marry her Stand forth Lysander and my gracious duke This man hath bewitchd the bosom of my child Thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes And interchanged love tokens with my child Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love And stolen the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits Knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardend youth With cunning hast thou filchd my daughters heart Turnd her obedience which is due to me To stubborn harshness and my gracious duke Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius I beg the ancient privilege of Athens As she is mine I may dispose of her Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death according to our law Immediately provided in that case THESEUS What say you Hermia be advised fair maid To you your father should be as a god One that composed your beauties yea and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it Demetrius is a worthy gentleman HERMIA So is Lysander THESEUS In himself he is But in this kind wanting your fathers voice The other must be held the worthier HERMIA I would my father lookd but with my eyes THESEUS Rather your eyes must with his judgment look HERMIA I do entreat your grace to pardon me I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case If I refuse to wed Demetrius THESEUS Either to die the death or to abjure For ever the society of men Therefore fair Hermia question your desires Know of your youth examine well your blood Whether if you yield not to your fathers choice You can endure the livery of a nun For aye to be in shady cloister mewd To live a barren sister all your life Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon Thrice blessed they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage But earthlier happy is the rose distilld Than that which withering on the virgin thorn Grows lives and dies in single blessedness HERMIA So will I grow so live so die my lord Ere I will my virgin patent up Unto his lordship whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty THESEUS Take time to pause and by the next new moon The sealing day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your fathers will Or else to wed Demetrius as he would Or on Dianas altar to protest For aye austerity and single life DEMETRIUS Relent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield Thy crazed title to my certain right LYSANDER You have her fathers love Demetrius Let me have Hermias do you marry him EGEUS Scornful Lysander true he hath my love And what is mine my love shall render him And she is mine and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius LYSANDER I am my lord as well derived as he As well possessd my love is more than his My fortunes every way as fairly rankd If not with vantage as Demetrius And which is more than all these boasts can be I am beloved of beauteous Hermia Why should not I then prosecute my right Demetrius Ill avouch it to his head Made love to Nedars daughter Helena And won her soul and she sweet lady dotes Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry Upon this spotted and inconstant man THESEUS I must confess that I have heard so much And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof But being over full of self affairs My mind did lose it But Demetrius come And come Egeus you shall go with me I have some private schooling for you both For you fair Hermia look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your fathers will Or else the law of Athens yields you up Which by no means we may extenuate To death or to a vow of single life Come my Hippolyta what cheer my love Demetrius and Egeus go along I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves EGEUS With duty and desire we follow you Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA LYSANDER How now my love why is your cheek so pale How chance the roses there do fade so fast HERMIA Belike for want of rain which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes LYSANDER Ay me for aught that I could ever read Could ever hear by tale or history The course of true love never did run smooth But either it was different in blood HERMIA O cross too high to be enthralld to low LYSANDER Or else misgraffed in respect of years HERMIA O spite too old to be engaged to young LYSANDER Or else it stood upon the choice of friends HERMIA O hell to choose love by anothers eyes LYSANDER Or if there were a sympathy in choice War death or sickness did lay siege to it Making it momentany as a sound Swift as a shadow short as any dream Brief as the lightning in the collied night That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth And ere a man hath power to say Behold The jaws of darkness do devour it up So quick bright things come to confusion HERMIA If then true lovers have been ever crossd It stands as an edict in destiny Then let us teach our trial patience Because it is a customary cross As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs Wishes and tears poor fancys followers LYSANDER A good persuasion therefore hear me Hermia I have a widow aunt a dowager Of great revenue and she hath no child From Athens is her house remote seven leagues And she respects me as her only son There gentle Hermia may I marry thee And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us If thou lovest me then Steal forth thy fathers house to morrow night And in the wood a league without the town Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May There will I stay for thee HERMIA My good Lysander I swear to thee by Cupids strongest bow By his best arrow with the golden head By the simplicity of Venus doves By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves And by that fire which burnd the Carthage queen When the false Troyan under sail was seen By all the vows that ever men have broke In number more than ever women spoke In that same place thou hast appointed me To morrow truly will I meet with thee LYSANDER Keep promise love Look here comes Helena Enter HELENA HERMIA God speed fair Helena whither away HELENA Call you me fair that fair again unsay Demetrius loves your fair O happy fair Your eyes are lode stars and your tongues sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherds ear When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear Sickness is catching O were favour so Yours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go My ear should catch your voice my eye your eye My tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody Were the world mine Demetrius being bated The rest Id give to be to you translated O teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius heart HERMIA I frown upon him yet he loves me still HELENA O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill HERMIA I give him curses yet he gives me love HELENA O that my prayers could such affection move HERMIA The more I hate the more he follows me HELENA The more I love the more he hateth me HERMIA His folly Helena is no fault of mine HELENA None but your beauty would that fault were mine HERMIA Take comfort he no more shall see my face Lysander and myself will fly this place Before the time I did Lysander see Seemd Athens as a paradise to me O then what graces in my love do dwell That he hath turnd a heaven unto a hell LYSANDER Helen to you our minds we will unfold To morrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass A time that lovers flights doth still conceal Through Athens gates have we devised to steal HERMIA And in the wood where often you and I Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet There my Lysander and myself shall meet And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies Farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius Keep word Lysander we must starve our sight From lovers food till morrow deep midnight LYSANDER I will my Hermia Exit HERMIA Helena adieu As you on him Demetrius dote on you Exit HELENA How happy some oer other some can be Through Athens I am thought as fair as she But what of that Demetrius thinks not so He will not know what all but he do know And as he errs doting on Hermias eyes So I admiring of his qualities Things base and vile folding no quantity Love can transpose to form and dignity Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind And therefore is wingd Cupid painted blind Nor hath Loves mind of any judgement taste Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste And therefore is Love said to be a child Because in choice he is so oft beguiled As waggish boys in game themselves forswear So the boy Love is perjured every where For ere Demetrius lookd on Hermias eyne He haild down oaths that he was only mine And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt So he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt I will go tell him of fair Hermias flight Then to the wood will he to morrow night Pursue her and for this intelligence If I have thanks it is a dear expense But herein mean I to enrich my pain To have his sight thither and back again Exit SCENE II Athens QUINCES

performing of it if I do it let the audience look to their eyes I will move storms I will condole in some measure To the rest yet my chief humour is for a tyrant I could play Ercles rarely or a part

bow strings Exeunt ACT II SCENE I A wood near Athens Enter from opposite sides a Fairy and PUCK PUCK How now spirit whither wander you Fairy Over hill over dale Thorough bush thorough brier Over park over pale Thorough flood thorough fire I do wander everywhere Swifter than the moons sphere And I serve the fairy queen To dew her orbs upon the green The cowslips tall her pensioners be In their gold coats spots you see Those be rubies fairy favours In those freckles live their savours I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslips ear Farewell thou lob of spirits Ill be gone Our queen and all our elves come here anon PUCK The king doth keep his revels here to night Take heed the queen come not within his sight For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king She never had so sweet a changeling And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train to trace the forests wild But she perforce withholds the loved boy Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy And now they never meet in grove or green By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen But they do square that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn cups and hide them there Fairy Either I mistake your shape and making quite Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Calld Robin Goodfellow are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery Skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern And bootless make the breathless housewife churn And sometime make the drink to bear no barm Mislead night wanderers laughing at their harm Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck You do their work and they shall have good luck Are not you he PUCK Thou speakst aright I am that merry wanderer of the night I jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and bean fed horse beguile Neighing in likeness of a filly foal And sometime lurk I in a gossips bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab And when she drinks against her lips I bob And on her witherd dewlap pour the ale The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale Sometime for three foot stool mistaketh me Then slip I from her bum down topples she And tailor cries and falls into a cough And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there But room fairy here comes Oberon Fairy And here my mistress Would that he were gone Enter from one side OBERON with his train from the other TITANIA with hers OBERON Ill met by moonlight proud Titania TITANIA What jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence I have forsworn his bed and company OBERON Tarry rash wanton am not I thy lord TITANIA Then I must be thy lady but I know When thou hast stolen away from fairy land And in the shape of Corin sat all day Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida Why art thou here Come from the farthest Steppe of India But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon Your buskind mistress and your warrior love To Theseus must be wedded and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity OBERON How canst thou thus for shame Titania Glance at my credit with Hippolyta Knowing I know thy love to Theseus Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigenia whom he ravished And make him with fair AEgle break his faith With Ariadne and Antiopa TITANIA These are the forgeries of jealousy And never since the middle summers spring Met we on hill in dale forest or mead By paved fountain or by rushy brook Or in the beached margent of the sea To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind But with thy brawls thou hast disturbd our sport Therefore the winds piping to us in vain As in revenge have suckd up from the sea Contagious fogs which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents The ox hath therefore stretchd his yoke in vain The ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attaind a beard The fold stands empty in the drowned field And crows are fatted with the murrion flock The nine mens morris is filld up with mud And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable The human mortals want their winter here No night is now with hymn or carol blest Therefore the moon the governess of floods Pale in her anger washes all the air That rheumatic diseases do abound And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter hoary headed frosts Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose And on old Hiems thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is as in mockery set the spring the summer The childing autumn angry winter change Their wonted liveries and the mazed world By their increase now knows not which is which And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate from our dissension We are their parents and original OBERON Do you amend it then it lies in you Why should Titania cross her Oberon I do but beg a little changeling boy To be my henchman TITANIA Set your heart at rest The fairy land buys not the child of me His mother was a votaress of my order And in the spiced Indian air by night Full often hath she gossipd by my side And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands Marking the embarked traders on the flood When we have laughd to see the sails conceive And grow big bellied with the wanton wind Which she with pretty and with swimming gait Following her womb then rich with my young squire Would imitate and sail upon the land To fetch me trifles and return again As from a voyage rich with merchandise But she being mortal of that boy did die And for her sake do I rear up her boy And for her sake I will not part with him OBERON How long within this wood intend you stay TITANIA Perchance till after Theseus wedding day If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels go with us If not shun me and I will spare your haunts OBERON Give me that boy and I will go with thee TITANIA Not for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away We shall chide downright if I longer stay Exit TITANIA with her train OBERON Well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury My gentle Puck come hither Thou rememberest Since once I sat upon a promontory And heard a mermaid on a dolphins back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the sea maids music PUCK I remember OBERON That very time I saw but thou couldst not Flying between the cold moon and the earth Cupid all armd a certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft Quenchd in the chaste beams of the watery moon And the imperial votaress passed on In maiden meditation fancy free Yet markd I where the bolt of Cupid fell It fell upon a little western flower Before milk white now purple with loves wound And maidens call it love in idleness Fetch me that flower the herb I shewd thee once The juice of it on sleeping eye lids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees Fetch me this herb and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league PUCK Ill put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes Exit OBERON Having once this juice Ill watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes The next thing then she waking looks upon Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull On meddling monkey or on busy ape She shall pursue it with the soul of love And ere I take this charm from off her sight As I can take it with another herb Ill make her render up her page to me But who comes here I am invisible And I will overhear their conference Enter DEMETRIUS HELENA following him DEMETRIUS I love thee not therefore pursue me not Where is Lysander and fair Hermia The one Ill slay the other slayeth me Thou toldst me they were stolen unto this wood And here am I and wode within this wood Because I cannot meet my Hermia Hence get thee gone and follow me no more HELENA You draw me you hard hearted adamant But yet you draw not iron for my heart Is true as steel leave you your power to draw And I shall have no power to follow you DEMETRIUS Do I entice you do I speak you fair Or rather do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you HELENA And even for that do I love you the more I am your spaniel and Demetrius The more you beat me I will fawn on you Use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me Neglect me lose me only give me leave Unworthy as I am to follow you What worser place can I beg in your love And yet a place of high respect with me Than to be used as you use your dog DEMETRIUS Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit For I am sick when I do look on thee HELENA And I am sick when I look not on you DEMETRIUS You do impeach your modesty too much To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity HELENA Your virtue is my privilege for that It is not night when I do see your face Therefore I think I am not in the night Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company For you in my respect are all the world Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me DEMETRIUS Ill run from thee and hide me in the brakes And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts HELENA The wildest hath not such a heart as you Run when you will the story shall be changed Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase The dove pursues the griffin the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed When cowardice pursues and valour flies DEMETRIUS I will not stay thy questions let me go Or if thou follow me do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood HELENA Ay in the temple in the town the field You do me mischief Fie Demetrius Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex We cannot fight for love as men may do We should be wood and were not made to woo Exit DEMETRIUS Ill follow thee and make a heaven of hell To die upon the hand I love so well Exit OBERON Fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love Re enter PUCK Hast thou the flower there Welcome wanderer PUCK Ay there it is OBERON I pray thee give it me I know a bank where the wild thyme blows Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows Quite over canopied with luscious woodbine With sweet musk roses and with eglantine There sleeps Titania sometime of the night Lulld in these flowers with dances and delight And there the snake throws her enamelld skin Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in And with the juice of this Ill streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies Take thou some of it and seek through this grove A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth anoint his eyes But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on Effect it with some care that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow PUCK Fear not my lord your servant shall do so Exeunt SCENE II Another part of the wood Enter TITANIA with her train TITANIA Come now a roundel and a fairy song Then for the third part of a minute hence Some to kill cankers in the musk rose buds Some war with rere mice for their leathern wings To make my small elves coats and some keep back The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders At our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep Then to your offices and let me rest The Fairies sing You spotted snakes with double tongue Thorny hedgehogs be not seen Newts and blind worms do no wrong Come not near our fairy queen Philomel with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby Never harm Nor spell nor charm Come our lovely lady nigh So good night with lullaby Weaving spiders come not here Hence you long leggd spinners hence Beetles black approach not near Worm nor snail do no offence Philomel with melody c Fairy Hence away now all is well One aloof stand sentinel Exeunt Fairies TITANIA sleeps Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIAs eyelids OBERON What thou seest when thou dost wake Do it for thy true love take Love and languish for his sake Be it ounce or cat or bear Pard or boar with bristled hair In thy eye that shall appear When thou wakest it is thy dear Wake when some vile thing is near Exit Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA LYSANDER Fair love you faint with wandering in the wood And to speak troth I have forgot our way Well rest us Hermia if you think it good And tarry for the comfort of the day HERMIA Be it so Lysander find you out a bed For I upon this bank will rest my head LYSANDER One turf shall serve as pillow for us both One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth HERMIA Nay good Lysander for my sake my dear Lie further off yet do not lie so near LYSANDER O take the sense sweet of my innocence Love takes the meaning in loves conference I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it Two bosoms interchained with an oath So then two bosoms and a single troth Then by your side no bed room me deny For lying so Hermia I do not lie HERMIA Lysander riddles very prettily Now much beshrew my manners and my pride If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied But gentle friend for love and courtesy Lie further off in human modesty Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid So far be distant and good night sweet friend Thy love neer alter till thy sweet life end LYSANDER Amen amen to that fair prayer say I And then end life when I end loyalty Here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest HERMIA With half that wish the wishers eyes be pressd They sleep Enter PUCK PUCK Through the forest have I gone But Athenian found I none On whose eyes I might approve This flowers force in stirring love Night and silence Who is here Weeds of Athens he doth wear This is he my master said Despised the Athenian maid And here the maiden sleeping sound On the dank and dirty ground Pretty soul she durst not lie Near this lack love this kill courtesy Churl upon thy eyes I throw All the power this charm doth owe When thou wakest let love forbid Sleep his seat on thy eyelid So awake when I am gone For I must now to Oberon Exit Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA running HELENA Stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius DEMETRIUS I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus HELENA O wilt thou darkling leave me do not so DEMETRIUS Stay on thy peril I alone will go Exit HELENA O I am out of breath in this fond chase The more my prayer the lesser is my grace Happy is Hermia wheresoeer she lies For she hath blessed and attractive eyes How came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears If so my eyes are oftener washd than hers No no I am as ugly as a bear For beasts that meet me run away for fear Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do as a monster fly my presence thus What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermias sphery eyne But who is here Lysander on the ground Dead or asleep I see no blood no wound Lysander if you live good sir awake LYSANDER Awaking And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake Transparent Helena Nature shows art That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart Where is Demetrius O how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword HELENA Do not say so Lysander say not so What though he love your Hermia Lord what though Yet Hermia still loves you then be content LYSANDER Content with Hermia No I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent Not Hermia but Helena I love Who will not change a raven for a dove The will of man is by his reason swayd And reason says you are the worthier maid Things growing are not ripe until their season So I being young till now ripe not to reason And touching now the point of human skill Reason becomes the marshal to my will And leads me to your eyes where I oerlook Loves stories written in loves richest book HELENA Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born When at your hands did I deserve this scorn Ist not enough ist not enough young man That I did never no nor never can Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius eye But you must flout my insufficiency Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do In such disdainful manner me to woo But fare you well perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness O that a lady of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused Exit LYSANDER She sees not Hermia Hermia sleep thou there And never mayst thou come Lysander near For as a surfeit of the sweetest things The deepest loathing to the stomach brings Or as tie heresies that men do leave Are hated most of those they did deceive So thou my surfeit and my heresy Of all be hated but the most of me And all my powers address your love and might To honour Helen and to be her knight Exit HERMIA Awaking Help me Lysander help me do thy best To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast Ay me for pity what a dream was here Lysander look how I do quake with fear Methought a serpent eat my heart away And you sat smiling at his cruel pray Lysander what removed Lysander lord What out of hearing gone no sound no word Alack where are you speak an if you hear Speak of all loves I swoon almost with fear No then I well perceive you all not nigh Either

dote on in extremity Enter PUCK Here comes my messenger How now mad spirit What night rule now about this haunted grove PUCK My mistress with a monster is in love Near to her close and consecrated bower While she was in her dull and sleeping hour A crew of patches rude mechanicals That work for bread upon Athenian stalls Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus nuptial day The shallowest thick skin of that barren sort Who Pyramus presented in their sport Forsook his scene and enterd in a brake When I did him at this advantage take An asss nole I fixed on his head Anon his Thisbe must be answered And forth my mimic comes When they him spy As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye Or russet pated choughs many in sort Rising and cawing at the guns report Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky So at his sight away his fellows fly And at our stamp here oer and oer one falls He murder cries and help from Athens calls Their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong Made senseless things begin to do them wrong For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch Some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there When in that moment so it came to pass Titania waked and straightway loved an ass OBERON This falls out better than I could devise But hast thou yet latchd the Athenians eyes With the love juice as I did bid thee do PUCK I took him sleeping that is finishd too And the Athenian woman by his side That when he waked of force she must be eyed Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS OBERON Stand close this is the same Athenian PUCK This is the woman but not this the man DEMETRIUS O why rebuke you him that loves you so Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe HERMIA Now I but chide but I should use thee worse For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep Being oer shoes in blood plunge in the deep And kill me too The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia Ill believe as soon This whole earth may be bored and that the moon May through the centre creep and so displease Her brothers noontide with Antipodes It cannot be but thou hast murderd him So should a murderer look so dead so grim DEMETRIUS So should the murderd look and so should I Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere HERMIA Whats this to my Lysander where is he Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me DEMETRIUS I had rather give his carcass to my hounds HERMIA Out dog out cur thou drivest me past the bounds Of maidens patience Hast thou slain him then Henceforth be never numberd among men O once tell true tell true even for my sake Durst thou have lookd upon him being awake And hast thou killd him sleeping O brave touch Could not a worm an adder do so much An adder did it for with doubler tongue Than thine thou serpent never adder stung DEMETRIUS You spend your passion on a misprised mood I am not guilty of Lysanders blood Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell HERMIA I pray thee tell me then that he is well DEMETRIUS An if I could what should I get therefore HERMIA A privilege never to see me more And from thy hated presence part I so See me no more whether he be dead or no Exit DEMETRIUS There is no following her in this fierce vein Here therefore for a while I will remain So sorrows heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe Which now in some slight measure it will pay If for his tender here I make some stay Lies down and sleeps OBERON What hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite And laid the love juice on some true loves sight Of thy misprision

That must needs be sport alone And those things do best please me That befal preposterously Enter LYSANDER and HELENA LYSANDER Why should you think that I should woo in scorn Scorn and derision never come in tears Look when I vow I weep and vows so born In their nativity all truth appears How can these things in me seem scorn to you Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true HELENA You do advance your cunning more and more When truth kills truth O devilish holy fray These vows are Hermias will you give her oer Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh Your vows to her and me put in two scales Will even weigh and both as light as tales LYSANDER I had no judgment when to her I swore HELENA Nor none in my mind now you give her oer LYSANDER Demetrius loves her and he loves not you DEMETRIUS Awaking O Helena goddess nymph perfect divine To what my love shall I compare thine eyne Crystal is muddy O how ripe in show Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow That pure congealed white high Taurus snow Fannd with the eastern wind turns to a crow When thou holdst up thy hand O let me kiss This princess of pure white this seal of bliss HELENA O spite O hell I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment If you we re civil and knew courtesy You would not do me thus much injury Can you not hate me as I know you do But you must join in souls to mock me too If you were men as men you are in show You would not use a gentle lady so To vow and swear and superpraise my parts When I am sure you hate me with your hearts You both are rivals and love Hermia And now both rivals to mock Helena A trim exploit a manly enterprise To conjure tears up in a poor maids eyes With your derision none of noble sort Would so offend a virgin and extort A poor souls patience all to make you sport LYSANDER You are unkind Demetrius be not so For you love Hermia this you know I know And here with all good will with all my heart In Hermias love I yield you up my part And yours of Helena to me bequeath Whom I do love and will do till my death HELENA Never did mockers waste more idle breath DEMETRIUS Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none If eer I loved her all that love is gone My heart to her but as guest wise sojournd And now to Helen is it home returnd There to remain LYSANDER Helen it is not so DEMETRIUS Disparage not the faith thou dost not know Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear Look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear Re enter HERMIA HERMIA Dark night that from the eye his function takes The ear more quick of apprehension makes Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense It pays the hearing double recompense Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so LYSANDER Why should he stay whom love doth press to go HERMIA What love could press Lysander from my side LYSANDER Lysanders love that would not let him bide Fair Helena who more engilds the night Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light Why seekst thou me could not this make thee know The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so HERMIA You speak not as you think it cannot be HELENA Lo she is one of this confederacy Now I perceive they have conjoind all three To fashion this false sport in spite of me Injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid Have you conspired have you with these contrived To bait me with this foul derision Is all the counsel that we two have shared The sisters vows the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty footed time For parting us O is it all forgot All school days friendship childhood innocence We Hermia like two artificial gods Have with our needles created both one flower Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion Both warbling of one song both in one key As if our hands our sides voices and minds Had been incorporate So we grow together Like to a double cherry seeming parted But yet an union in partition Two lovely berries moulded on one stem So with two seeming bodies but one heart Two of the first like coats in heraldry Due but to one and crowned with one crest And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend It is not friendly tis not maidenly Our sex as well as I may chide you for it Though I alone do feel the injury HERMIA I am amazed at your passionate words I scorn you not it seems that you scorn me HELENA Have you not set Lysander as in scorn To follow me and praise my eyes and face And made your other love Demetrius Who even but now did spurn me with his foot To call me goddess nymph divine and rare Precious celestial Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates and wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love so rich within his soul And tender me forsooth affection But by your setting on by your consent What thought I be not so in grace as you So hung upon with love so fortunate But miserable most to love unloved This you should pity rather than despise HERNIA I understand not what you mean by this HELENA Ay do persever counterfeit sad looks Make mouths upon me when I turn my back Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up This sport well carried shall be chronicled If you have any pity grace or manners You would not make me such an argument But fare ye well tis partly my own fault Which death or absence soon shall remedy LYSANDER Stay gentle Helena hear my excuse My love my life my soul fair Helena HELENA O excellent HERMIA Sweet do not scorn her so DEMETRIUS If she cannot entreat I can compel LYSANDER Thou canst compel no more than she entreat Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers Helen I love thee by my life I do I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not DEMETRIUS I say I love thee more than he can do LYSANDER If thou say so withdraw and prove it too DEMETRIUS Quick come HERMIA Lysander whereto tends all this LYSANDER Away you Ethiope DEMETRIUS No no hell Seem to break loose take on as you would follow But yet come not you are a tame man go LYSANDER Hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent HERMIA Why are you grown so rude what change is this Sweet love LYSANDER Thy love out tawny Tartar out Out loathed medicine hated potion hence HERMIA Do you not jest HELENA Yes sooth and so do you LYSANDER Demetrius I will keep my word with thee DEMETRIUS I would I had your bond for I perceive A weak bond holds you Ill not trust your word LYSANDER What should I hurt her strike her kill her dead Although I hate her Ill not harm her so HERMIA What can you do me greater harm than hate Hate me wherefore O me what news my love Am not I Hermia are not you Lysander I am as fair now as I was erewhile Since night you loved me yet since night you left me Why then you left me O the gods forbid In earnest shall I say LYSANDER Ay by my life And never did desire to see thee more Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt Be certain nothing truer tis no jest That I do hate thee and love Helena HERMIA O me you juggler you canker blossom You thief of love what have you come by night And stolen my loves heart from him HELENA Fine ifaith Have you no modesty no maiden shame No touch of bashfulness What will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue Fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you HERMIA Puppet why so ay that way goes the game Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures she hath urged her height And with her personage her tall personage Her height forsooth she hath prevaild with him And are you grown so high in his esteem Because I am so dwarfish and so low How low am I thou painted maypole speak How low am I I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes HELENA I pray you though you mock me gentlemen Let her not hurt me I was never curst I have no gift at all in shrewishness I am a right maid for my cowardice Let her not strike me You perhaps may think Because she is something lower than myself That I can match her HERMIA Lower hark again HELENA Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me I evermore did love you Hermia Did ever keep your counsels never wrongd you Save that in love unto Demetrius I told him of your stealth unto this wood He followd you for love I followd him But he hath chid me hence and threatend me To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too And now so you will let me quiet go To Athens will I bear my folly back And follow you no further let me go You see how simple and how fond I am HERMIA Why get you gone who ist that hinders you HELENA A foolish heart that I leave here behind HERMIA What with Lysander HELENA With Demetrius LYSANDER Be not afraid she shall not harm thee Helena DEMETRIUS No sir she shall not though you take her part HELENA O when shes angry she is keen and shrewd She was a vixen when she went to school And though she be but little she is fierce HERMIA Little again nothing but low and little Why will you suffer her to flout me thus Let me come to her LYSANDER Get you gone you dwarf You minimus of hindering knot grass made You bead you acorn DEMETRIUS You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services Let her alone speak not of Helena Take not her part for if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her Thou shalt aby it LYSANDER Now she holds me not Now follow if thou darest to

Exit OBERON This is thy negligence still thou mistakest Or else committst thy knaveries wilfully PUCK Believe me king of shadows I mistook Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment be had on And so far blameless proves my enterprise That I have nointed an Athenians eyes And so far am I glad it so did sort As this their jangling I esteem a sport OBERON Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight Hie therefore Robin overcast the night The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within anothers way Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong And sometime rail thou like Demetrius And from each other look thou lead them thus Till oer their brows death counterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep Then crush this herb into Lysanders eye Whose liquor hath this virtuous property To take from thence all error with his might And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight When they next wake all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision And back to Athens shall the lovers wend With league whose date till death shall never end Whiles I in this affair do thee employ Ill to my queen and beg her Indian boy And then I will her charmed eye release From monsters view and all things shall be peace PUCK My fairy lord this must be done with haste For nights swift dragons cut the clouds full fast And yonder shines Auroras harbinger At whose approach ghosts wandering here and there Troop home to churchyards damned spirits all That in crossways and floods have burial Already to their wormy beds are gone For fear lest day should look their shames upon They willfully themselves exile from light And must for aye consort with black browd night OBERON But we are spirits of another sort I with the mornings love have oft made sport And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate all fiery red Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams But notwithstanding haste make no delay We may effect this business yet ere day Exit PUCK Up and down up and down I

hateful fool I did upbraid her and fall out with her For she his hairy temples then had rounded With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers And that same dew which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls Stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail When I had at my pleasure taunted her And she in mild terms beggd my patience I then did ask of her her changeling child Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in fairy land And now I have the boy I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes And gentle Puck take this transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain That he awaking when the other do May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this nights

Valentine is past Begin these wood birds but to couple now LYSANDER Pardon my lord THESEUS I pray you all stand up I know you two are rival enemies How comes this gentle concord in the world That hatred is so far from jealousy To sleep by hate and fear no enmity LYSANDER My lord I shall reply amazedly Half sleep half waking but as yet I swear I cannot truly say how I came here But as I think for truly would I speak And now do I bethink me so it is I came with Hermia hither our intent Was to be gone from Athens where we might Without the peril of the Athenian law EGEUS Enough enough my lord you have enough I beg the law the law upon his head They would have stolen away they would Demetrius Thereby to have defeated you and me You of your wife and me of my consent Of my consent that she should be your wife DEMETRIUS My lord fair Helen told me of their stealth Of this their purpose hither to this wood And I in fury hither followd them Fair Helena in fancy following me But my good lord I wot not by what power But by some power it is my love to Hermia Melted as the snow seems to me now As the remembrance of an idle gaud Which in my childhood I did dote upon And all the faith the virtue of my heart The object and the pleasure of mine eye Is only Helena To her my lord Was I betrothd ere I saw Hermia But like in sickness did I loathe this food But as in health come to my natural

way let us recount our dreams Exeunt BOTTOM Awaking When my cue comes call me and I will answer my next is Most fair Pyramus Heigh ho Peter Quince Flute the bellows mender Snout the tinker Starveling Gods my life stolen hence and left me asleep I have had a most rare vision I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream

your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look oer his part for the short and the long is our play is preferred In any case let Thisby have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pair his nails for they shall hang out for the lions claws And most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy No more words away go away Exeunt ACT V SCENE I Athens The palace of THESEUS Enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA PHILOSTRATE Lords and Attendants HIPPOLYTA Tis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak of THESEUS More strange than true I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys Lovers and madmen have such seething brains Such shaping fantasies that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends The lunatic the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact One sees more devils than vast hell can hold That is the madman the lover all as frantic Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Egypt The poets eye in fine frenzy rolling Doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown the poets pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name Such tricks hath strong imagination That if it would but apprehend some joy It comprehends some bringer of that joy Or in the night imagining some fear How easy is a bush supposed a bear HIPPOLYTA But all the story of the night told over And all their minds transfigured so together More witnesseth than fancys images And grows to something of great constancy But howsoever strange and admirable THESEUS Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth Enter LYSANDER DEMETRIUS HERMIA and HELENA Joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts LYSANDER More than to us Wait in your royal walks your board your bed THESEUS Come now what masques what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after supper and bed time Where is our usual manager of mirth What revels are in hand Is there no play To ease the anguish of a torturing hour Call Philostrate PHILOSTRATE Here mighty Theseus THESEUS Say what abridgement have you for this evening What masque what music How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight PHILOSTRATE There is a brief how many sports are ripe Make choice of which your highness will see first Giving a paper THESEUS Reads The battle with the Centaurs to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp Well none of that that have I told my love In glory of my kinsman Hercules Reads The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage That is an old device and it was playd When I from Thebes came last a conqueror Reads The thrice three Muses mourning for the death Of Learning late deceased in beggary That is some satire keen and critical Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony Reads A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus And his love Thisbe very tragical mirth Merry and tragical tedious and brief That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow How shall we find the concord of this discord PHILOSTRATE A play there is my lord some ten words long Which is as brief as I have known a play But by ten words my lord it is too long Which makes it tedious for in all the play There is not one word apt one player fitted And tragical my noble lord it is For Pyramus therein doth kill himself Which when I saw rehearsed I must confess Made mine eyes water but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed THESEUS What are they that do play it PHILOSTRATE Hard handed men that work in Athens here Which never labourd in their minds till now And now have toild their unbreathed memories With this same play against your nuptial THESEUS And we will hear it PHILOSTRATE No my noble lord It is not for you I have heard it over And it is nothing nothing in the world Unless you can find sport in their intents Extremely stretchd and connd with cruel pain To do you service THESEUS I will hear that play For never anything can be amiss When simpleness and duty tender it Go bring them in and take your places ladies Exit PHILOSTRATE HIPPOLYTA I love not to see wretchedness oer charged And duty in his service perishing THESEUS Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing HIPPOLYTA He says they can do nothing in this kind THESEUS The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing Our sport shall be to take what they mistake And what poor duty cannot do noble respect Takes it in might not merit Where I have come great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes Where I have seen them shiver and look pale Make periods in the midst of sentences Throttle their practised accent in their fears And in conclusion dumbly have broke off Not paying me a welcome Trust me sweet Out of this silence yet I pickd a welcome And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence Love therefore and tongue tied simplicity In least speak most to my capacity Re enter PHILOSTRATE PHILOSTRATE So please your grace the Prologue is addressd THESEUS Let him approach Flourish of trumpets Enter QUINCE for the Prologue Prologue If we offend it is with our good will That you should think we come not to offend But with good will To show our simple skill That is the true beginning of our end Consider then we come but in despite We do not come as minding to contest you Our true intent is All for your delight We are not here That you should here repent you The actors are at hand and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know THESEUS This fellow doth not stand upon points LYSANDER He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop A good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true HIPPOLYTA Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government THESEUS His speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered Who is next Enter Pyramus and Thisbe Wall Moonshine and Lion Prologue Gentles perchance you wonder at this show But wonder on till truth make all things plain This man is Pyramus if you would know This beauteous lady Thisby is certain This man with lime and rough cast doth present Wall that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder And through Walls chink poor souls they are content To whisper At the which let no man wonder This man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn Presenteth Moonshine for if you will know By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus tomb there there to woo This grisly beast which Lion hight by name The trusty Thisby coming first by night Did scare away or rather did affright And as she fled her mantle she did fall Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain Anon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall And finds his trusty Thisbys mantle slain Whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade He bravely broachd is boiling bloody breast And Thisby tarrying in mulberry shade His dagger drew and died For all the rest Let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain At large discourse while here they do remain Exeunt Prologue Thisbe Lion and Moonshine THESEUS I wonder if the lion be to speak DEMETRIUS No wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do Wall In this same interlude it doth befall That I one Snout by name present a wall And such a wall as I would have you think That had in it a crannied hole or chink Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisby Did whisper often very secretly This loam this rough cast and this stone doth show That I am that same wall the truth is so And this the cranny is right and sinister Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper THESEUS Would you desire lime and hair to speak better DEMETRIUS It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse my lord Enter Pyramus THESEUS Pyramus draws near the wall silence Pyramus O grim lookd night O night with hue so black O night which ever art when day is not O night O night alack alack alack I fear my Thisbys promise is forgot And thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall That standst between her fathers ground and mine Thou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne Wall holds up his fingers Thanks courteous wall Jove shield thee well for this But what see I No Thisby do I see O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me THESEUS The wall methinks being sensible should curse again Pyramus No in truth sir he should not Deceiving me is Thisbys cue she is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall You shall see it will fall pat as I told you Yonder she comes Enter Thisbe Thisbe O wall full often hast thou heard my moans For parting my fair Pyramus and me My cherry lips have often kissd thy stones Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee Pyramus I see a voice now will I to the chink To spy an I can hear my Thisbys face Thisby Thisbe My love thou art my love I think Pyramus Think what thou wilt I am thy lovers grace And like Limander am I trusty still Thisbe And I like Helen till the Fates me kill Pyramus Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true Thisbe As Shafalus to Procrus I to you Pyramus O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall Thisbe I kiss the walls hole not your lips at all Pyramus Wilt thou at Ninnys tomb meet me straightway Thisbe Tide life tide death I come without delay Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe Wall Thus have I Wall my part discharged so And being done thus Wall away doth go Exit THESEUS Now is the mural down between the two neighbours DEMETRIUS No remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning HIPPOLYTA This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard THESEUS The best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them HIPPOLYTA It must be your imagination then and not theirs THESEUS If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men Here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion Enter Lion and Moonshine Lion You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor May now perchance both quake and tremble here When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar Then know that I one Snug the joiner am A lion fell nor else no lions dam For if I should as lion come in strife Into this place twere pity on my life THESEUS A very gentle beast of a good conscience DEMETRIUS The very best at a beast my lord that eer I saw LYSANDER This lion is a very fox for his valour THESEUS True and a goose for his discretion DEMETRIUS Not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose THESEUS His discretion I am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox It is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon Moonshine This lanthorn doth the horned moon present DEMETRIUS He should have worn the horns on his head THESEUS He is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference Moonshine This lanthorn doth the horned moon present Myself the man i the moon do seem to be THESEUS This is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn How is it else the man i the moon DEMETRIUS He dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff HIPPOLYTA I am aweary of this moon would he would change THESEUS It appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time LYSANDER Proceed Moon Moonshine All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon I the man in the moon this thorn bush my thorn bush and this dog my dog DEMETRIUS Why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon But silence here comes Thisbe Enter Thisbe Thisbe This is old Ninnys tomb Where is my love Lion Roaring Oh Thisbe runs off DEMETRIUS Well roared Lion THESEUS Well run Thisbe HIPPOLYTA Well shone Moon Truly the moon shines with a good grace The Lion shakes Thisbes mantle and exit THESEUS Well moused Lion LYSANDER And so the lion vanished DEMETRIUS And then came Pyramus Enter Pyramus Pyramus Sweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams I thank thee Moon for shining now so bright For by thy gracious golden glittering gleams I trust to take of truest Thisby sight But stay O spite But mark poor knight What dreadful dole is here Eyes do you see How can it be O dainty duck O dear Thy mantle good What staind with blood Approach ye Furies fell O Fates come come Cut thread and thrum Quail crush conclude and quell THESEUS This passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad HIPPOLYTA Beshrew my heart but I pity the man Pyramus O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame Since lion vile hath here deflowerd my dear Which is no no which was the fairest dame That lived that loved that liked that lookd with cheer Come tears confound Out sword and wound The pap of Pyramus Ay that left pap Where heart doth hop Stabs himself Thus die I thus thus thus Now am I dead Now am I fled My soul is in the sky Tongue lose thy light Moon take thy flight Exit Moonshine Now die die die die die Dies DEMETRIUS No die but an ace for him for he is but one LYSANDER Less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing THESEUS With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass HIPPOLYTA How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover THESEUS She will find him by starlight Here she comes and her passion ends the play Re enter Thisbe HIPPOLYTA Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus I hope she will be brief DEMETRIUS A mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which Thisbe is the better he for a man God warrant us she for a woman God bless us LYSANDER She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes DEMETRIUS And thus she means videlicet Thisbe Asleep my love What dead my dove O Pyramus arise Speak speak Quite dumb Dead dead A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes These My lips This cherry nose These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone are gone Lovers make moan His eyes were green as leeks O Sisters Three Come come to me With hands as pale as milk Lay them in gore Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk Tongue not a word Come trusty sword Come blade my breast imbrue Stabs herself And farewell friends Thus Thisby ends Adieu adieu adieu Dies THESEUS Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead DEMETRIUS Ay and Wall too BOTTOM Starting up No assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers Will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company THESEUS No epilogue I pray you for your play needs no excuse Never excuse for when the players are all dead there needs none to be blamed Marry if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbes garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged But come your Bergomask let your epilogue alone A dance The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve Lovers to bed tis almost fairy time I fear we shall out sleep the coming morn As much as we this night have overwatchd This palpable gross play hath well beguiled The heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed A fortnight hold we this solemnity In nightly revels and new jollity Exeunt Enter PUCK PUCK Now the hungry lion roars And the wolf behowls the moon Whilst the heavy ploughman snores All with weary task fordone Now the wasted brands do glow Whilst the screech owl screeching loud Puts the wretch that lies in woe In remembrance of a shroud Now it is the time of night That the graves all gaping wide Every one lets forth his sprite In the church way paths to glide And we fairies that do run By the triple Hecates team From the presence of the sun Following darkness like a dream Now are frolic not a mouse Shall disturb this hallowd house I am sent with broom before To sweep the dust behind the door Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train OBERON Through the house give gathering light By the dead and drowsy fire Every elf and fairy sprite Hop as light as bird from brier And this ditty after me Sing and dance it trippingly TITANIA First rehearse your song by rote To each word a warbling note Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place Song and dance OBERON Now until the break of day Through this house each fairy stray To the best bride bed will we Which by us shall blessed be And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate So shall all the couples three Ever true in loving be And the blots of Natures hand Shall not in their issue stand Never mole hare lip nor scar Nor mark prodigious such as are Despised in nativity Shall upon their children be With this field dew consecrate Every fairy take his gait And each several chamber bless Through this palace with sweet peace And the owner of it blest Ever shall in safety rest Trip away make no stay Meet me all by break of day Exeunt OBERON TITANIA and train PUCK If we shadows have offended Think but this and all is mended That you have but slumberd here While these visions did appear And this weak and idle theme No more yielding but a dream Gentles do not reprehend if you pardon we will mend And as I am an honest Puck If we have unearned luck Now to scape the serpents tongue We will make amends ere long Else the Puck a liar call So good night unto you all Give me your hands if we be friends And Robin shall restore amends
